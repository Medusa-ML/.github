# 🐍 Medusa 🐍

Medusa is a **free and open source** and **cross-platform** collection of Machine Learning models, primarily focusing on image and text processing for tasks like classification and generation. We develop our own models during our annual [bootcamps/hackathons](https://bradflaugher.com/bootcamp.html) 🚀 and contribute to large open-source projects! 💪

## 🧑‍🏫 Training Materials

See the [AI Harmony Book](https://github.com/Medusa-ML/AI-Harmony-Book) and the [Bootcamp](https://github.com/Medusa-ML/Bootcamp) repositories.

## 📜 Note on Forked Projects and Licensing

Some of Medusa's projects are forks from original repositories that were under permissive licenses such as MIT or Apache. Medusa respects the original licenses of these repositories. Any new code contributions by the Medusa project to these forks are licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPLv3). For an example, see our [Medusa Project Fork Licensing Note](https://github.com/Medusa-ML/Chat/blob/main/LICENSING_NOTE).

### Compatibility Note

It's important to note that although our forks aim to remain upstream-compatible, they are essentially hard forks under a more restrictive license (GPLv3). This is in line with our commitment to free software and our belief in the benefits of more restrictive licenses that ensure freedom and openness.

### Encouragement for License Transition to GPLv3

We strongly encourage original project authors, whose repositories Medusa has forked, to consider re-licensing under the GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPLv3). Adopting this more restrictive license will enable you to integrate enhancements and improvements contributed by the Medusa team back into your original codebase. This synergistic approach aligns with best practices in free and open-source software development, while providing mutual benefits to all parties involved.

For more information on this matter check out the [Free Software Foundation's Licensing Lab](https://www.fsf.org/licensing/) for a list of other Open Source AI projects check out the [Free Software Directory AI Project Team](https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Artificial_Intelligence_Project_Team)
