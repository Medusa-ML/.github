# Medusa

a collection of open source cross-platform ml models, mostly working with images and text to either classify or generate. We create our own models (during annual [bootcamps/hackathons](https://bradflaugher.com/bootcamp.html)) and contribute to large open source projects (Neural Style Transfer, Open-Assistant and others)

## Models in Development
